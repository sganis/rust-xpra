# rust-xpra

Xpra client implemented in [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), for MS Windows and Linux.

## Status

It builds on MS Windows and Linux (X11 and Wayland).

It supports `tcp`/`ssl`/`ws`/`wss` connections, plus `ssh` (via a subprocess, see below) and direct Unix-domain
socket connections on Unix platforms. `ssl`/`wss` verify the server's certificate against the system trust
store, unless `--ssl-insecure` says otherwise. Password authentication is supported (HMAC digest challenges —
see [Authentication](#authentication) below).

It requires an **xpra 6.6 or later** server: every packet it sends uses the packet types introduced in
xpra 6.5, the `window-ack` draw acknowledgement and the `clipboard-data` layout only settled in 6.6.
The hello says so — `protocol-version: [6, 6]` is the oldest peer this client will talk to, and a server that
cannot satisfy it says "incompatible version" instead of failing later on an unknown packet type.
The server may be run in either mode: nothing sent depends on `XPRA_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBLE`, and the
packets the client *receives* are accepted under both their pre-6.5 and their current names.

There is no server implementation. Plain-text clipboard synchronization is supported, as is automatic
server-to-client speaker forwarding on Windows. On Linux, a server running on the same host sends its pixels
through shared memory rather than the socket — see [Shared memory transfers](#shared-memory-transfers).

On MS Windows there is a system tray icon with an **Exit** menu entry, and server-forwarded
notifications are shown as balloons on it — see [System tray](#system-tray). Elsewhere notifications are only
written to the client log.

`Ctrl-C` ends the session gracefully rather than killing the client under a live connection: the server is told
why we are leaving (it logs `client has requested disconnection: client interrupted`) before the process exits
with code 0. `SIGTERM` and `SIGHUP` do the same on Unix, as does closing the console window on MS Windows. A
second interrupt terminates the process the ordinary way, so a shutdown stuck on a dead connection is still
interruptible. On Linux, where there is no tray icon and therefore no **Exit** menu entry, this is the only
clean way out.

### Windows speaker forwarding

On Windows 10 and later, server audio is enabled automatically when the system Media Foundation Opus decoder and
the default WASAPI output endpoint are available. The client negotiates only the bare `opus` codec (no Matroska
or Ogg container), receives audio asynchronously, and renders it through a bounded adaptive jitter buffer. If
the native probe or output-device recovery fails, audio is disabled for that session without disconnecting it.

Speaker forwarding is receive-only in this milestone: microphone forwarding, non-Opus codecs, and audio output
on Linux/macOS are not implemented.

### Known Linux limitations

The windowing/painting layer is built on [winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit) +
[softbuffer](https://github.com/rust-windowing/softbuffer), which run on both platforms, but the Wayland protocol
itself does not let clients query or set their absolute desktop position:
- Override-redirect windows (used by the server for tooltips/menus/dropdowns) have no Wayland equivalent at all,
  and degrade to undecorated, non-resizable but still WM-managed windows (visible in taskbars/window-switchers,
  unlike true override-redirect).
- Server-initiated window moves (`window-move-resize`) only apply the size on Wayland; the position component is
  silently skipped.
- Outgoing window geometry (`window-map`/`window-configure`) reports `(0, 0)` as the position on Wayland, since
  there is no OS API to query it.
- NumLock state is not reported to the server (winit does not expose toggle/lock key state, only held
  modifiers).

Running under XWayland (the X11 backend) instead of native Wayland avoids all of the above.

Server-forwarded bells (`bell`) play a real tone on Windows, but on Linux fall back to writing the terminal
bell (`^G`) to stderr - there is no portable desktop bell without an X11 or audio-server dependency, which this
client avoids - so a bell is only audible when the client was started from a terminal whose bell is enabled.

There is no system tray icon on Linux either (see [System tray](#system-tray) below): the freedesktop
StatusNotifierItem protocol needs a D-Bus dependency, and the older XEmbed tray is X11-only. Server-forwarded
notifications are shown as balloons on that tray icon, so they too are Windows-only and are merely logged here.

## Downloads

Pre-built binaries for MS Windows and Linux are attached to each
[release](https://github.com/Xpra-org/rust-xpra/releases) on GitHub.

Linux packages (RPM and DEB) are also published to the xpra repositories, under the package name
`rust-xpra` — see [Download](https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/wiki/Download) for how to add the repository for
your distribution, then:

```shell
dnf install rust-xpra     # or: apt install rust-xpra
```

These packages are currently published to the `beta` repository. They install the client as
**`/usr/bin/rust-xpra`** rather than `/usr/bin/xpra`, so that they can be installed alongside the python `xpra`
package (which owns that path); everything below that calls the binary `xpra` refers to a locally built one.

## Usage

```shell
cargo build
./target/debug/xpra                 # asks for the connection details, see below
./target/debug/xpra HOST:PORT
./target/debug/xpra tcp://HOST:PORT/
./target/debug/xpra ssl://HOST:PORT/
./target/debug/xpra ws://HOST:PORT/
./target/debug/xpra wss://HOST:PORT/
./target/debug/xpra ssh://[USER@]HOST[:PORT]/[DISPLAY]
./target/debug/xpra socket:///run/user/1000/xpra/10   # Unix only
./target/debug/xpra /run/user/1000/xpra/10            # equivalent shorthand
./target/debug/xpra --ssl-insecure ssl://HOST:PORT/   # skip certificate verification
./target/debug/xpra --remote-xpra=/opt/xpra/bin/xpra ssh://HOST/10   # remote xpra off PATH
./target/debug/xpra --help          # or -h: the same list, plus the environment variables
./target/debug/xpra --version       # this client's own version (not the xpra protocol version)
```

Options and the target may be given in either order. An argument starting with `-` that is not a known option
is an error rather than something to connect to, so a mistyped option can never be read as a hostname.

Started **without any argument**, the client opens a small connection dialog instead of exiting: a protocol
drop-down (which pre-fills the port with that protocol's default — 10000, or 22 for `ssh`), a host, a port, and
an optional username and password, plus **Cancel** and **Connect**. `Tab` moves between the fields, the arrow
keys pick the protocol, `Enter` connects and `Esc` cancels (exit status `0`). The connection is made in the
background, so the dialog stays responsive and reports a failure (wrong port, no server, bad certificate, ...)
in place, ready for another attempt, rather than exiting.

The username is only part of the connection itself for `ssh` (`ssh://USER@HOST/`); for the other protocols it is
sent in the client's `hello`, which is what a server authenticating per-user matches against. The password is
the *session* password — it answers the server's authentication challenge (see [Authentication](#authentication))
without prompting again — and never the ssh password: `ssh` asks for its own credentials on the terminal.

Like the password prompt, the dialog is drawn with the same `winit`/`softbuffer` stack as the rest of the client
(there is no widget toolkit here — windows are server-rendered pixels), with its text blitted from a bundled
bitmap font: [Spleen](https://github.com/fcambus/spleen) 8x16, Copyright (c) 2018-2026, Frederic Cambus,
BSD-2-Clause.

Only the `tcp`, `ssl`, `ws`, `wss`, `ssh` and `socket` protocols are supported; any other protocol in the URI is
rejected. On Unix platforms, `socket:///absolute/path` connects directly to a filesystem pathname Unix-domain
socket; a bare `/absolute/path` is equivalent shorthand. This does no `:DISPLAY` lookup or socket-directory
discovery, and abstract-namespace sockets are not supported. Socket targets are command-line only and do not
appear in the no-argument connection dialog. They are unavailable on Windows.

`ws` support (HTTP upgrade handshake and frame framing) is hand-rolled against `std` only, to avoid pulling in a
websocket crate and its dependencies. `ssl`/`wss` use [`native-tls`](https://docs.rs/native-tls) (OpenSSL on
Linux, Schannel on Windows, Security.framework on macOS) rather than a hand-rolled implementation, since TLS
encryption (unlike WebSocket masking) is a real security boundary. The server's certificate chain **and** its
hostname are verified against the system trust store; `--ssl-insecure` turns both checks off, for the
self-signed certificates xpra servers commonly use on local and test setups:

```shell
./target/debug/xpra --ssl-insecure ssl://HOST:PORT/
```

A connection made with `--ssl-insecure` is encrypted but not authenticated, and so is open to interception —
it is no better than `tcp://` against an active attacker. There is no way to trust a private CA yet, so that
flag is currently the only way to reach a server whose certificate the system does not already trust.

`ssh` shells out to the system `ssh` binary and uses its stdin/stdout pipes as the byte stream (no SSH library
dependency), running `xpra _proxy [DISPLAY]` on the remote end — the same mechanism xpra's own client uses to
bridge stdin/stdout to an existing display's socket. This requires a working `ssh` in `PATH` (OpenSSH on Linux,
or the bundled OpenSSH client on Windows 10 1809+) and `xpra` installed on the remote host.

`--remote-xpra=PATH` runs that `xpra` from a path instead of looking the name up on the remote login shell's
`PATH`, which is what reaches a relocatable install under a shared prefix — how xpra is deployed on hosts that
carry no xpra package and where no one has root. The path goes through the same `command -v` guard as the bare
name, so a wrong one is reported as `no xpra command found: <path>` rather than as a broken connection. The
option is only meaningful for `ssh://`, and giving it with another target is an error. Authentication must
not require interactive input on stdin (stdin carries the xpra protocol, not a terminal), so use key-based auth
via an ssh-agent or a passphrase-less key; host-key confirmation and password prompts still work normally since
OpenSSH reads those from the controlling terminal, not stdin.

### Without a system ssh

Where there is no usable `ssh` binary — a workstation where the OpenSSH client is not installed, or where policy
blocks it — build with `--features ssh-native` and the client speaks SSH itself, through
[russh](https://crates.io/crates/russh), with no subprocess:

```shell
cargo build --release --features ssh-native
```

The feature is **off by default** and the two transports are mutually exclusive: a default build has no SSH
library in it at all, and its dependency graph is unchanged. Nothing outside `src/net/ssh/` differs between them,
and neither does the command line.

It is not a superset of the subprocess transport, because everything that came free with OpenSSH has to be
reimplemented: `~/.ssh/config` is **not** read (host, port and user come from the target URI only), and there is
no `ProxyJump`/`ProxyCommand`, no host certificate, no FIDO or PKCS#11 key and no GSSAPI/Kerberos. What it does
support:

* **Authentication**, tried in OpenSSH's order and skipping whatever the server does not offer: the ssh-agent
  (`$SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, or the `\\.\pipe\openssh-ssh-agent` named pipe on Windows), then `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`,
  `id_ecdsa` and `id_rsa` (or the one key `XPRA_SSH_KEY` names), then keyboard-interactive, then a password.
  RSA keys are signed with SHA-512, not the SHA-1 anything recent refuses.
* **Host keys**, checked against `~/.ssh/known_hosts` (or `XPRA_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS`) exactly as OpenSSH does: a
  known key is accepted silently, an unknown one is put to the user and recorded when they accept, and a key
  that *changed* is refused outright and never prompted for.
* **Prompting** without a terminal, since `connect` runs before there is an event loop: the connection dialog's
  password field when the target came from there, then `XPRA_SSH_PASSWORD`, then `pinentry` (`GETPIN` for a
  secret, `CONFIRM` for the host key), and `XPRA_SSH_ACCEPT_NEW_HOST=yes` for an unattended client that has no
  way to be asked. Each question is asked at most once, so a wrong password fails the connection instead of
  looping.

## System tray

On MS Windows the client puts an icon in the notification area for as long as it is connected. Right-clicking it
opens a menu naming the session (`xpra @ HOST:PORT`) with an **Exit** entry, which is the only way to shut the
client down from the GUI — closing a window only tells the server to close that window. Exiting this way sends a
`disconnect` to the server first and exits with status `0`.

The icon is `assets/xpra.ico`, embedded into the executable by `build.rs` (which also embeds `exe.manifest`, the
per-monitor-V2 DPI manifest, so it is the executable's icon in Explorer too). It is implemented directly on
`Shell_NotifyIconW` through the `windows` crate that Media Foundation already requires, so it adds no new
dependency and no extra thread — the tray window is created on the UI thread and winit's own message loop pumps
it.

### Notifications

The same icon also carries **desktop notifications**: a notification forwarded by the server becomes a balloon
on the tray icon, with the notification's summary as the title and its body as the text. This needs no notifier
library — it is one more `Shell_NotifyIconW` call — which is why it is Windows-only. On Windows 10 and later the
shell renders these as toasts, so they follow the user's notification settings and Focus assist, and may land in
the Action Center instead of appearing on screen.

Only the text is used: notification *actions* (buttons) and hints are ignored, as are per-notification icons and
the server's expiry timeout (Windows has ignored the requested balloon timeout since Vista, in favour of the
system accessibility timeout). A notification the server withdraws is taken back, if it is still the one being
shown.

There is no tray, and therefore no notifications, on Linux or macOS — the client just logs them (both platforms
would need a D-Bus dependency this client avoids).

## Authentication

Servers that require a password (xpra's `password`/`file`/`multifile`/`sqlite`/`pam`/... auth modules) send a
`challenge`; the client answers it with an HMAC-SHA256 digest of the password. When a challenge arrives, the
password is obtained from — in order:

1. the connection dialog's password field, when the client was started without arguments and it was filled in;
2. the `XPRA_PASSWORD` environment variable, if set (non-interactive; handy for scripts);
3. [`pinentry`](https://www.gnupg.org/related_software/pinentry/), if one is found on `PATH` (honouring
   `PINENTRY_PROGRAM`) — the same native, secure prompt GnuPG uses (GTK/Qt/curses on Linux, `pinentry-mac` on
   macOS);
4. otherwise a small built-in password dialog (drawn with the same `winit`/`softbuffer` stack as the rest of the
   client), so a prompt is always available — including on Windows, where `pinentry` is normally absent.

Only the `hmac+sha256` digest is implemented (it is the only one advertised, so the server always picks it);
Kerberos/GSS/SCRAM/U2F and the legacy `xor`/`des` digests are not supported and fail cleanly. The HMAC response
never reveals the password itself, and the server mixes in a fresh per-connection salt so a captured response
cannot be replayed — but the session payload is still in the clear over `tcp`/`ws`, so use `ssl`/`wss` (or `ssh`)
for confidentiality.

## Picture encodings

`jpeg` (libjpeg-turbo), `png` (libspng), `webp` (libwebp), and `h264` on Windows only (decoded by the OS through
Media Foundation, no codec is bundled).

### Shared memory transfers

When the server runs on the same host as the client, encoding pixels only to decode them again is wasted work.
Xpra's answer is `mmap`: the client creates a backing file, maps it shared and tells the server where it is, and
the server writes raw uncompressed frames straight into it — the `draw` packets then carry nothing but offsets
into that area. Transfers become lossless and cost a `memcpy` instead of a decode.

This is **on by default on Linux** (as it is in xpra's own client), for the server → client direction only.
Nothing has to be configured and nothing is lost when it does not apply: the client always offers an area, and a
server that cannot open the file — because it is on another host — simply declines, leaving the session on the
usual picture encodings. Neither side compares hostnames; each writes a random token into the area for the other
to read back, which is what establishes that the two really are looking at the same memory.

The backing file is created in the temporary directory, is 128MB and sparse, and is unlinked as soon as the
server has it open, so it never outlives the handshake. Note that while mmap is in use the server stops using
every other picture encoding, which is the intended effect.

| Variable         | Effect                                                                          |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `XPRA_MMAP`      | `no` to switch it off; an absolute path to pin the backing file (an existing file is used as-is and never removed, which is how a [virtio-shmem](https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra/blob/master/docs/Subsystems/MMAP.md) device is shared between a host and a guest) |
| `XPRA_MMAP_DIR`  | the directory to create the file in (the temporary directory by default)         |
| `XPRA_MMAP_SIZE` | the size of the area, with an optional `K`/`M`/`G` suffix (128M default, 64M minimum — the server rejects anything smaller) |

Not implemented: the client → server direction (the server only uses it for webcam frames, which this client
does not have), and Windows, where the equivalent is a named file mapping rather than a file and would only ever
help against a shadow server on the same machine.

### Linking libwebp

By default `libwebp` is built from the vendored C sources and linked **statically**, so that the release binaries
are self-contained — this needs no extra tooling (a C compiler only: no `cmake`, no `nasm`, no `bindgen`).

Distribution packages generally must not bundle their own copy of a library the distribution already ships and has
to be able to patch, so there is a feature to link the system `libwebp` shared library instead (located with
`pkg-config`):

```shell
cargo build --release --features webp-dylib
```

## Dependencies

Keeping the dependency graph small is a deliberate constraint here — it is why the WebSocket layer and the SHA1
and HMAC-SHA256 implementations are hand-rolled against `std` rather than pulled from crates, and why `ssh`
shells out to the system binary instead of linking a client — the in-process SSH client is there for the hosts
that need it, as the opt-in `ssh-native` feature above, and costs nothing when it is off.

**[xpra-org.github.io/rust-xpra](https://xpra-org.github.io/rust-xpra/dependency-graph.html)** maps what is
actually there: for each direct dependency, its full transitive closure, which crates it is the *only* route to
(what dropping it would really remove), and which of those are linked into the binary rather than merely run at
build time. The same page is committed as `docs/dependency-graph.html` and is entirely self-contained, so it
works offline from a checkout too.

As of 0.3.0, the Linux graph is 124 crates — 98 linked and 26 build-time only (build scripts and proc-macros) —
against 77 on Windows, of which 53 are linked and 24 build-time only. The windowing stack dominates both: `winit`
alone accounts for 76 of the Linux total, 33 of which nothing else reaches, and `softbuffer` adds only 9 more on
top of it. The page also flags crates present at more than one version — `rustix` and `linux-raw-sys` on Linux,
the `windows-sys`/`windows-result`/`windows-strings` trio on Windows.

Regenerate it after changing a dependency (needs python 3 and `cargo`, nothing else):

```shell
python3 docs/dependency-graph.py
```

[`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) describes what the page shows, how the data is derived, and how it is
published.
