# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project status

Proof-of-concept [Xpra](https://xpra.org/) client written in Rust, for MS Windows and Linux (X11 and Wayland).
Not usable yet: `tcp`/`ssl`/`ws`/`wss` connections (`ssl`/`wss` verify certificates against the system trust
store, with `--ssl-insecure` to opt out; there is still no way to trust a private CA — see
`README.md`), plus `ssh` (via a subprocess by default, or in-process with `--features ssh-native`);
no server/audio/clipboard support. Password
authentication *is* supported (the `hmac+sha256` challenge digest only — see the `challenge` flow below and
`README.md`). See `README.md` for known Linux/Wayland limitations (window positioning, override-redirect, NumLock
— all downstream of Wayland not letting clients query/set absolute desktop position or create truly unmanaged
windows). MS Windows has a system tray icon with an `Exit` menu entry, which doubles as the notification
backend (server notifications become tray balloons — `src/client/tray.rs`); Linux has no tray
(StatusNotifierItem would need D-Bus, the XEmbed tray is X11-only) and therefore only logs notifications.

## Build / run

Cross-platform: builds on Windows and Linux via `winit` + `softbuffer` (no native GTK/Qt dependency). CI builds
both (see `.github/workflows/rust.yml`). On Linux, building needs `pkg-config` and X11/Wayland/xkbcommon dev
headers (see the `build-linux` job for the exact package list). Windows builds additionally want a resource
compiler on `PATH` (`rc.exe` from the Windows SDK, which the CI runners have) to embed the icon and manifest —
see `build.rs` under "Known repo quirks"; without one the build still succeeds, just with a warning.

```shell
cargo build
./target/debug/xpra HOST:PORT     # xpra.exe on Windows
./target/debug/xpra wss://HOST:PORT/
./target/debug/xpra               # no argument: ask for the details (src/client/connect_dialog.rs)
./target/debug/xpra --help        # or -h: the target forms and the environment variables
./target/debug/xpra --version     # `CLIENT_VERSION` only (= the crate version)
```

`src/lib.rs` holds both versions and they must not be conflated: `VERSION` ("6.4") is the *xpra
protocol* version announced to the server in the hello, `CLIENT_VERSION` is this crate's own
(`env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")`) and is the only one `--version` prints.

`.cargo/config.toml` sets `TURBOJPEG_SOURCE=pkg-config` + `TURBOJPEG_STATIC=1` so that `turbojpeg` links against
the system libjpeg-turbo (needs its dev headers, and version >= 3.0) instead of compiling `turbojpeg-sys`' vendored
copy. Cargo's `[env]` does not override variables already set in the process environment, so both CI workflows set
`TURBOJPEG_SOURCE=vendor` in their top-level `env:` block to opt back into the vendored build — the GitHub runners
have no libjpeg-turbo 3.x (and the Windows ones no `pkg-config`). Same escape hatch locally: set
`TURBOJPEG_SOURCE=vendor` in the environment (requires `cmake` + `nasm`) if the system libjpeg-turbo is too old.

`libwebp-sys` is the opposite default: it builds its **vendored** libwebp C sources with `cc` and links them
statically, which is what the all-in-one CI release binaries want and needs no extra tooling (no `cmake`/`nasm`/
`bindgen` — the bindings are pre-generated). Downstream packagers who must link the distro's shared libwebp
instead build with `--features webp-dylib` (see `Cargo.toml`), which is what the RPM and DEB builds under
`packaging/` do; it turns on `libwebp-sys/system-dylib` and makes
its `build.rs` `pkg-config`-probe the system library rather than compiling the vendored copy. The two modes are
interchangeable: the FFI surface is identical, so no code outside `Cargo.toml` is conditional on the feature.

There are no automated tests for the GUI/protocol dispatch layer — verify changes manually against a real Xpra
server (`xpra start :100 --bind-tcp=127.0.0.1:PORT --auth=none --tcp-auth=none` works well for local testing).
What *is* covered runs under **`cargo test`**, not `cargo test --lib`: the lib target only holds `net/`, so
`--lib` skips everything in `src/client/` (the audio jitter buffer, the connect dialog's URI building, window
metadata parsing, the logger's date arithmetic) and runs three of the tests instead of all of them.

## Architecture

The crate has both a library part (`xpra`, `src/lib.rs`) and a binary (`src/main.rs`).

- `src/lib.rs` / `src/net/`: the Xpra wire-protocol layer, platform-independent.
  - `net/uri.rs`: `parse_target` turns the command-line argument into a `Target { scheme, address, path, username }`,
    accepting a bare `host:port` (assumed `tcp`), a bare absolute Unix socket path, or a
    `protocol://host:port/path` URI. `Scheme` is one of `Tcp`/`Tls`/`WebSocket`/`WebSocketTls`/`Ssh`/`Socket`
    (`tcp`/`ssl`/`ws`/`wss`/`ssh`/`socket`); anything else is rejected. `socket:///absolute/path` and its bare
    `/absolute/path` shorthand put the pathname in `address` and leave `path` empty.
    `host_only` strips the port for use as the TLS SNI/hostname argument (handles bracketed IPv6 correctly).
    `Ssh` alone allows a `user@` authority prefix (→ `username`) and defaults the port to 22 if omitted (the other
    schemes always require an explicit port); its `path` is stripped of the leading `/` since it's passed through
    as a bare xpra display number, not a URI path.
  - `net/connection.rs`: `Connection` is an enum (`Tcp`/`Tls`/`WebSocket`/`WebSocketTls`/`Ssh`, plus Unix-only
    `Socket`) implementing
    `Read`/`Write` by dispatching to whichever transport is active, so the rest of the codebase (`io.rs`,
    `XpraClient`) doesn't need to know which one it's talking to. `try_clone()` gives the reader thread its own
    independent instance. `Connection::write_all` special-cases `Tls` to call `SharedTlsStream::write_all` (see
    below) rather than the generic `Write::write_all`.
    `Socket` wraps `std::os::unix::net::UnixStream` and connects directly to a filesystem pathname; there is no
    display lookup, socket-directory discovery, or abstract-namespace support. It is CLI-only because the
    no-argument connection dialog deliberately has no socket option, and non-Unix builds return a platform-support
    error when a parsed socket target is connected.
  - `net/tls.rs`: `ssl://`/`wss://`, via `native-tls` (OpenSSL/Schannel/Security.framework) rather than a
    hand-rolled implementation — unlike WebSocket masking, TLS encryption is a real security boundary.
    The certificate chain and the hostname **are verified** against the platform trust store, which is what
    `native-tls` does with no configuration at all; `--ssl-insecure` turns both off
    (`danger_accept_invalid_certs`/`danger_accept_invalid_hostnames`), mirroring the go client's flag of the same
    name, and `main::connect` rejects that flag on a target that is not `ssl://`/`wss://`. There is still no way
    to trust a private CA, so that flag is the only escape hatch for the self-signed certificates xpra servers
    commonly use; see `README.md`. `SharedTlsStream` wraps the single
    `TlsStream` in an `Arc<Mutex<_>>` so the reader thread and the UI thread (writer) can share it — a single TLS
    session isn't safe for concurrent use by two threads (see xpra's own `SSLSocketConnection`, which hits the
    same OpenSSL issue). The socket is put in **true non-blocking mode**, not a read *timeout* on an otherwise-
    blocking socket: OpenSSL only guarantees a safe retry after `WouldBlock` for a genuinely non-blocking
    transport. `SharedTlsStream::write_all` holds the lock for the *whole* write (including across `WouldBlock`
    retries), so a concurrent writer (the reader thread's automatic pong reply to a WebSocket ping, over `wss://`)
    can never interleave its bytes into the middle of another writer's frame — this was a real, reproducible bug
    (moving the mouse/typing while `wss://`-connected corrupted the packet stream) before both fixes landed.
  - `net/websocket.rs`: a minimal hand-rolled RFC 6455 client (HTTP upgrade handshake + frame masking/framing) —
    deliberately not using a websocket crate, since the protocol needed here is small; see `README.md`. Generic
    over the underlying stream (`TcpStream` for `ws://`, `SharedTlsStream` for `wss://`) via the `CloneableStream`
    trait, whose `write_frame` is what routes TLS writes through the atomic `SharedTlsStream::write_all` above.
    Requires a `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: binary` header for the xpra server to accept the upgrade.
    `WebSocketStream` buffers one reassembled (defragmented) message at a time and serves it through `Read`,
    transparently answering pings.
  - `net/sha1.rs`: a self-contained SHA1 (only used for the websocket accept-hash, not security-sensitive) — has
    unit tests with the standard RFC 3174 test vectors, run via `cargo test`.
  - `net/sha256.rs`: a self-contained SHA-256 + HMAC-SHA256, used to answer the server's password `challenge`
    (see the client's `process_challenge`). Unlike `sha1` this *is* a security boundary, so it is verified against
    the FIPS-180 and RFC 4231 test vectors (`cargo test`). Hand-rolled rather than pulling in a crypto crate,
    matching the rest of `net/`; `hmac_sha256_hex` returns the lowercase-hex ASCII form xpra puts on the wire.
  - `net/ssh/`: `ssh://`, in **two mutually exclusive implementations** picked at build time. Both expose the same
    `connect()` signature and the same `SshStream` type, so `net/connection.rs` and `main::connect` do not know
    which is in use, and `mod.rs` holds what they share: the remote command `sh -c 'if command -v "xpra" ...;
    then xpra _proxy [DISPLAY]; else ...; fi'`, matching what xpra's own client runs over ssh (see
    `xpra/net/ssh/exec_client.py:get_ssh_command` upstream) — `xpra _proxy` bridges stdin/stdout on the remote end
    to the target display's existing unix-domain socket — plus `SshPrompt`, the two callbacks (`secret`,
    `confirm`) through which prompting enters, since `net/` is the library half and cannot reach the dialogs and
    pinentry in `client/` (`client/ask.rs` builds it).
    - `ssh/exec.rs` (**the default**): shells out to the system `ssh` binary (`std::process::Command`) and treats
      its stdin/stdout pipes as the byte stream — no SSH library in the default build, mirroring the `tcp`/`ws`
      hand-rolled-over-a-library preference here. `SshStream` wraps `ChildStdin`/`ChildStdout` each in their own
      `Arc<Mutex<_>>` purely so `try_clone()` can hand the reader thread its own handle; unlike `SharedTlsStream`
      these two mutexes are never actually contended, since stdin and stdout are independent pipes (only the UI
      thread ever locks `stdin`, only the reader thread ever locks `stdout`). The spawned `Child` is moved into a
      dedicated reaper thread that blocks on `child.wait()`, since `Child::drop` neither kills nor waits on the
      process and would otherwise leave a zombie once ssh exits. Authentication must not require interactive
      stdin (it carries the xpra protocol); host-key/password prompts still work since OpenSSH reads those from
      the controlling terminal, not stdin — ssh's stderr is inherited so such prompts/errors are visible. It
      ignores `SshPrompt`: `ssh` does its own asking.
    - `ssh/native.rs` + `ssh/auth.rs` + `ssh/host.rs` (`--features ssh-native`): speaks SSH itself through
      `russh`, for the hosts where there is no usable `ssh` binary — a corporate workstation where the OpenSSH
      client is absent or blocked by policy. It is **not** a superset of the above: no `ssh_config`, no
      `ProxyJump`, no host certificates, no FIDO/PKCS#11 keys, no GSSAPI/Kerberos. Off by default, and the
      default build's dependency graph is unchanged (an optional dependency nothing enables does not appear in
      `cargo tree`, so `docs/dependency-graph.html` stays byte-identical — that is the check that the feature is
      really off). The traps:
      - **The bridge is blocking-over-async.** russh is async and `Connection` is not, so the session runs on a
        dedicated thread with a `new_current_thread` runtime and `SshStream` is a pair of channels into it: an
        unbounded queue of `(bytes, ack)` outbound, a `std::sync::mpsc` of chunks inbound. `connect()` blocks
        until the handshake, authentication and `exec` have all succeeded, so a failure is still a failure to
        *connect* (`ExitCode::SshFailure`, with no window ever opened).
      - **The `yield_now` in `pump` is load-bearing, and measured.** `Channel::data_bytes().await` returns once
        russh's session task has been *handed* the bytes, and russh's `poll_flush` is a no-op, so nothing in its
        API means "the bytes are on the socket". Writing one packet and calling `process::exit` immediately —
        which is what `disconnect_and_quit` amounts to — landed **0 of 15 bytes** at the far end without that
        yield and all 15 with it. The session task shares the single-threaded runtime and is runnable the moment
        the message is queued, so yielding before acknowledging the write lets it encrypt and write first.
        Removing it silently breaks the goodbye packet, which no test can see.
      - **stderr has to be logged explicitly.** The exec path inherits ssh's stderr; here the remote command's
        stderr arrives as `ChannelMsg::ExtendedData`, and that is where `no xpra command found` shows up, so
        `step` logs it at warn. Without it a missing remote xpra looks like a session that simply hangs.
      - `exec` is sent with `want_reply` and `open()` waits for the `ChannelMsg::Success`/`Failure` before
        reporting the session up, which is what turns "the remote host cannot run that command" into a
        connect-time error. That reply always precedes the program's own output, so nothing is lost by waiting.
      - **An empty `ChannelMsg::Data` must never reach the inbox**: `Inbox::read` returns `Ok(0)` for an empty
        chunk, which the reader thread reads as the connection being lost.
      - `auth.rs` starts with `authenticate_none`, which is not an authentication attempt but the question "which
        methods do you take?" — the failure it draws lists them, and everything after skips what the server will
        not accept. Every prompt is asked **at most once** (`SshPrompt` is one-shot by contract), so a wrong
        password fails the connection instead of looping on the same answer. RSA is signed with SHA-512: an agent
        signs with SHA-1 unless told otherwise, and modern servers refuse that.
      - russh declares the `Signer` trait for agent-backed public-key authentication but **implements it for
        nothing**, despite a doc comment saying otherwise, so `auth.rs` implements it over `AgentClient`. The
        stream type is erased with `dynamic()` so that the Unix socket and the Windows named pipe
        (`\\.\pipe\openssh-ssh-agent`, or `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` when it names one) are one type.
      - `auth::home()` prefers **`USERPROFILE` over `HOME` on Windows**: a Git Bash / MSYS shell exports a `HOME`
        holding a POSIX path (`/c/Users/name`) that the process cannot open, which silently made every host
        unknown and every key invisible.
      - `host.rs` mirrors OpenSSH's `known_hosts` policy, and a **changed** key is refused outright, never
        prompted for. `learn_known_hosts_path` leads with a newline, so the first entry it ever writes lands on
        line 2 — which is the line number the error message quotes.
      - There are no automated tests for the transport itself: `tests/ssh.rs` is an `#[ignore]`d integration test
        that starts a real `sshd` on a free port and connects through it, which the CI job `ssh-native` runs.
        Everything reachable without a server (the inbox, the write acknowledgement, `known_hosts`, identity
        order, address splitting) is unit-tested next to the code.
  - `net/io.rs`: packet framing over a `Connection` — 8-byte header (`'P'` magic, flags byte where bit 2 must be
    `FLAGS_YAML`, compression byte, chunk byte, 4-byte big-endian payload length) followed by the payload, written
    as a single `Connection::write_all` call. We write only YAML-encoded, uncompressed, unchunked packets (the
    header's compression/chunk bytes are always 0 outbound), and reject a non-YAML main packet on read.
    **Out-of-band chunks are supported inbound** (hello capability `chunks: true`): rather than base64-inlining a
    large binary item into the YAML payload, the server sends it as its own packet whose header's chunk byte is
    the index of the packet field it belongs to — pixel data (index 7 of a `draw`), window icons, cursors. The
    chunks come first, the main packet last with index 0, so `read_packet` loops until it sees index 0 and returns
    a `RawPacket { payload, chunks }`; `serde::parse_packet` moves the chunks into `Packet.raw`, where `get_bytes`
    reads them in preference to the empty placeholder the sender left in the YAML. A chunk header names no packet
    encoder (its flags byte is 0), so the `FLAGS_YAML` check applies to the main packet only — which also sets
    `FLAGS_FLUSH` (0x8) alongside it, hence a mask rather than an equality test. The limits mirror xpra's own
    receive loop (`process_payload`): chunk index < 16, at most 4 chunks, no duplicate index.
    **Inbound lz4 is supported**, too: the client advertises `compressors=["lz4"]` + a non-zero
    `compression_level` in its hello (see `send_hello`), so the server compresses its packets to us — including,
    right away, the large hello reply. When the header's compression byte is non-zero, `read_packet` decompresses
    the payload before returning it (`decompress`): the algorithm is in the byte's high bits (`0x10`=lz4,
    `0x40`=brotli, `0x80`=zstd, low nibble = level; xpra `net/protocol/header.py`) and only lz4 is accepted, since
    it's the only compressor we advertise. A chunk can carry its own compression the same way (xpra's
    `LevelCompressed`); an unsupported algorithm there is *not* fatal — the chunk is dropped with a warning and
    the field reads back empty, because the server brotli-compresses clipboard payloads over ~380 bytes without
    negotiating it (`server/source/clipboard.py`), and losing a paste beats losing the session. xpra's lz4 framing
    is a 4-byte little-endian uncompressed-size prefix +
    a raw lz4 block, which is exactly `lz4_flex`'s size-prepended block format (pure-Rust, `default-features` off
    so no xxhash/frame dependency; `safe-decode` for memory safety on adversarial input). Outbound packets stay
    uncompressed — they're small input events, all below the server's `MIN_COMPRESS_SIZE`, so there's nothing to
    gain and no compressor is linked for the write path.
  - `net/serde.rs`: `parse_packet` turns a `RawPacket` into a `Packet` — the YAML payload gives the positional
    fields, the out-of-band chunks become `raw`.
  - `net/packet.rs`: `Packet { main: Vec<Yaml>, raw: HashMap<u8, Vec<u8>> }` — `main` holds the positional fields
    of an Xpra packet (`main[0]` is always the packet type string); `raw` holds binary payloads that get spliced
    in by index (the wire's out-of-band chunks, and the decode thread's decoded pixel data). Accessors
    (`get_u32`, `get_str`, `get_bytes`, `get_hash_str`, ...) index into `main` by position — except `get_bytes`,
    which returns the `raw` entry for that index when there is one — matching the Xpra packet spec per packet type. `Packet` is `Send` (plain
    owned data) — it's passed directly across threads via `EventLoopProxy`, see below.

- `src/client/` (declared via `mod client;` in `main.rs`, submodules listed in `src/client/mod.rs`): the GUI
  client, built on `winit` (cross-platform windowing/event loop) + `softbuffer` (cross-platform CPU pixel
  presentation) — one implementation for both Windows and Linux.
  - `client.rs`: `XpraClient` implements `winit::application::ApplicationHandler<Packet>` directly and is the
    central state machine — owns the `Connection`, a `HashMap<u64, XpraWindow>` keyed by Xpra window id (`wid`),
    a reverse `HashMap<WindowId, u64>` (`id_map`) for looking up `wid` from winit's `WindowId` in
    `window_event`, the shared `softbuffer::Context`, and the `EventLoopProxy<Packet>`/`mpsc::Sender<Packet>`
    used to move packets between threads. Unlike the old Win32 version there's no global singleton — winit hands
    `&mut self` straight into `resumed`/`user_event`/`window_event`. `do_process_packet` dispatches incoming
    packets by their type string (`hello`, `new-window`/`window-create`, `new-override-redirect`,
    `window-move-resize`, `lost-window`/`window-destroy`, `window-metadata`, `draw`/`window-draw`,
    `draw-decoded`, `draw-failed`, `disconnect`/`connection-close`, `interrupt`, ...);
    outgoing packets are built with `serde_json::json!` and sent via `write_json` → `net::io::write_packet` (`hello`,
    `window-focus`, `pointer-motion`, `pointer-button`, `keyboard-event`, `window-map`, `window-configure`,
    `window-close`, `window-ack`, `ping`, `ping-echo`, `logging-event`, `connection-close`, the
    `clipboard-*` family and the `audio-*` family). Keyboard mapping (`physical_key_to_xpra_keycode`/`key_to_xpra_keyname`) derives the
    X11-style `keycode`/`keyname` xpra expects from winit's `PhysicalKey`/`Key` — see inline comments; extend the
    `NamedKey`/punctuation tables there if a real server session shows a key not being recognized.
    - **Nothing sent is conditional on the server's backwards-compatible mode.** The hello opens
      with `protocol-version: [6, 6]` (`MIN_PROTOCOL_VERSION`, `src/lib.rs`) — the oldest peer
      this client is willing to talk to, which a server checks against its own version
      (`protocol_compat_check`, xpra `util/version.py`, reached from `_process_hello`) and refuses
      with "incompatible version" rather than failing later on a packet type it has never heard
      of. It is the mirror image of the same key in the server's hello, which announces *its*
      minimum (`MIN_PROTOCOL_VERSION`, xpra `net/common.py`: `(5, 1)` in backwards-compatible mode,
      `(6, 6)` without it); we do not check that one, since the protocol version we announce
      (`VERSION`, "6.4") is older than the packets we actually speak and would fail it. A server
      too old to know the key at all simply ignores it.
    - **Packet names use the post-6.5 forms.** xpra 6.5 renamed most client→server packets and put
      the old names behind `add_legacy_alias(...)` calls that only run when the server has
      `BACKWARDS_COMPATIBLE` (`XPRA_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBLE`, default on); the
      authoritative old→new table is xpra's `net/packet_type.py`. Three of the renames are *not* plain
      renames and must not be "simplified" back into positional packets: `keyboard-event` moved
      everything after `pressed` into an attributes dict, `window-configure` moved geometry/state/
      properties into a config dict, and `clipboard-data` (which replaced `clipboard-token`) moved the
      targets and per-target payloads into an options dict. Draw acknowledgement was the sharp edge
      and no longer is: the sequence-first `seq, wid, w, h` layout has *two* names (`damage-sequence`
      in backwards-compatible mode, `window-draw-ack` without it), but its wid-first replacement
      `window-ack` — `wid, w, h, seq` — is named unconditionally and its handler registered in both
      modes (xpra `server/subsystem/window.py` `_process_ack`), so that is the only one sent. It
      arrived in 6.6, not 6.5: a 6.5 server has no `window-ack` at all, which is why the real
      minimum server version is 6.6, which is what `MIN_PROTOCOL_VERSION` announces. To check for
      regressions, run a server with `XPRA_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBLE=0`: it then refuses every legacy
      name outright.
      Two hello capabilities are part of the same move: the packet encoder (`encoders: ["yaml"]`) and
      the picture encodings (`encoding.options`/`encoding.core`). Each replaced a pre-6.5 spelling —
      a bare `yaml: true` and a top-level `encodings` list — that the server reads only in
      backwards-compatible mode *and* only when the modern form is absent, which makes both pure
      dead weight; neither is sent any more. Without `encoders` a non-backwards-compatible server
      drops the connection with "failed to negotiate a packet encoder", and without
      `encoding.options` with "client failed to specify any supported encodings".
      The *incoming* side accepts **both** spellings of every packet this client handles, so a
      server run with `XPRA_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBLE=0` gets a full session — verified against 6.6:
      windows (including override-redirect ones), draws, input, clipboard both ways, pings and a
      clean shutdown. Almost all of them are pure renames — the server has a single send site
      picking the name off a `net/packet_type.py` constant, so the layouts cannot drift — and
      those simply share one match arm: `window-draw`/`draw`, `window-destroy`/`lost-window`,
      `window-eos`/`eos`, `window-create`/`new-window`, `window-raise`/`raise-window`,
      `window-initiate-moveresize`/`initiate-moveresize`, `window-grab`/`pointer-grab`,
      `window-ungrab`/`pointer-ungrab`, `window-bell`/`bell`,
      `notification-show`/`notify_show`, `notification-close`/`notify_close`,
      `display-show-desktop`/`show-desktop`, `clipboard-status`/`set-clipboard-enabled`,
      `events`/`server-event`, `ping-echo`/`ping_echo`, `connection-close`/`disconnect`,
      `audio-data`/`sound-data`. `window-move-resize` covers the legacy
      `configure-override-redirect` as well, and `encoding-set` the legacy `encodings` (nothing
      else uses that name, so it needs no gating). Two need more than an alias:
      - `clipboard-data` — the replacement for `clipboard-token` is a different *shape*, so it has
        its own handler (`process_clipboard_data`); see the clipboard note below.
      - `window-create` — it also replaces `new-override-redirect`, which a modern server never
        sends; see the override-redirect note below.
      The cursor packets are the exception to the "accept both spellings" rule, because their
      layout is *negotiated* rather than inherited from the server's mode: our hello asks for
      `cursor.backwards-compatible: false`, which the server honours whatever mode it runs in
      (xpra `server/source/cursor.py`), so only `cursor-data` and `cursor-default` can arrive and
      the legacy `cursor` packet — pointer coordinates and cursor-size list included — is not
      handled at all. Still unimplemented in either spelling: `window-restack`/`restack-window`,
      `window-resized`, the file-transfer and webcam families. Adding an incoming rename means
      matching both names on one arm.
    - **Server encodings** (`process_encoding_set`): `["encoding-set", {"encodings": {...},
      "video": {...}}]` carries the picture encodings the server can send. It is a packet rather
      than a hello capability because the server only knows them once its codecs have loaded in its
      init thread (`threaded_init_complete`, xpra `server/source/encoding.py`); a pre-6.5 server
      sends the same dict without `video`. Nothing is applied from it — what *we* decode is fixed in
      the hello (`client_encodings`, the one list `encoding.options`/`encoding.core` are built from)
      and the server picks a per-window encoding out of the intersection itself — so the handler logs
      the lists and warns only when that intersection is empty, which would otherwise show up as a
      session that simply stays blank.
    - **Server events**: the hello advertises `events: true`, enabling informational
      `server-event` packets for lifecycle events such as `handshake-complete`, `startup-complete`,
      `suspend`, `resume`, and `exit`. `process_server_event` logs the event name and optional
      arguments but deliberately does not alter client state; dedicated protocol packets remain
      authoritative.
    - **Pings**: we advertise `ping: true` (which is what makes the server instantiate its
      `PingConnection` at all, so that it echoes ours), and the server's hello answers with the
      ping subsystem's *own* interval under the same key — `0` when it was started with
      `--pings=0`, and no key at all when the subsystem is not loaded (`--minimal`), in which case
      it has no handler for the packet and answers one with "unknown or invalid packet type". So
      `start_ping_loop` runs only for a non-zero value (`server_ping`, set in `process_hello`),
      and **a missing capability means off** — unlike xpra's own client, which assumes pings are
      supported when the key is absent (`c.boolget("ping", BACKWARDS_COMPATIBLE)`,
      `client/subsystem/ping.py`). Pings only feed the server's latency statistics, so not
      sending them costs nothing, while guessing wrong is a protocol error. Replying to the
      server's pings (`process_ping` → `ping-echo`) is unconditional — under that name, the one
      the server registers in both modes (`ping_echo`, with the underscore, is only its legacy
      alias, so a server run with `XPRA_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBLE=0` answers it with "unknown or
      invalid packet type"). Verified against a real
      server with pings, with `--pings=0`, and with `--minimal`.
    - **Window forwarding** is advertised in the nested `window` caps dict (`enabled`), *not* by
      the top-level `windows` flag, which `wants_windows` (xpra `server/common.py`) only consults
      in backwards-compatible mode and which is no longer sent. Without the dict a server run with
      `XPRA_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBLE=0` has no window subsystem at all
      (`WindowsConnection.is_needed`) and forwards no windows whatsoever — verified: adding the
      dict is what makes such a server start sending `window-create`.
    - **Pointer grabs**: `window.grabs` — in that same dict, since the window subsystem is what
      parses it (`parse_client_caps`) — enables `pointer-grab` and `pointer-ungrab` packets when a
      remote application grabs its pointer. (The legacy spelling was `pointer.grabs`, which a
      backwards-compatible server still falls back to; it is not sent.) The client asks winit
      for `CursorGrabMode::Confined`, falls back to `Locked`, tracks the owning `wid`, and releases
      the grab on an ungrab packet or before destroying the grabbed window.
    - **The other subsystem gates.** A subsystem the hello does not ask for is never instantiated
      server-side (`is_needed`, xpra `server/source/*.py`), so each of these keys is load-bearing
      and each has a pre-6.5 spelling that only a backwards-compatible server reads:
      `pointer` (legacy: `mouse`) is what makes our `pointer-motion`/`pointer-button` packets do
      anything, and must be a **dict** — `parse_client_caps` reads it with `dictget`, which logs
      "failed to convert 'pointer'" for a bare `true` — while only its truthiness matters, since
      none of its options (double-click timings, initial position, pointer echo) apply here;
      `cursor` (legacy: `cursors`) is a dict too, holding the encodings and the packet-layout
      choice; `keyboard`, `bell`, `ping`, `events`, `clipboard` and `display` are read under those
      names in both modes.
      **`notification` is the one exception and both spellings are sent.** Its `is_needed` takes
      either, but `NotificationConnection.parse_client_caps` (xpra
      `server/source/notification.py`) reads *only* the pre-6.5 `notifications: {enabled: true}`
      dict when the server is backwards-compatible — the default — with no fallback to the modern
      flag, so sending the flag alone loads the subsystem and then never delivers a notification
      (verified: `client.0.notification=False` in `xpra info`). Sending both gives
      `notification=True` in either mode.
    - **Local display**: the hello carries a nested `display` caps dict holding `desktop_size`
      (the bounding box of every monitor, in physical pixels) and `monitors` (their individual
      geometries). Both come from `local_monitors`/`total_display_size`, measured in `resumed`
      since that is the first callback with an `ActiveEventLoop` — winit enumerates monitors
      through it — and cached on `XpraClient` so the challenge-reply hello matches. The server
      logs the total as "client total display size" and a seamless server resizes its virtual
      screen to it (`do_parse_screen_info`, xpra `server/subsystem/display.py`); with `monitors`
      as well, an X11 server whose dummy driver has RandR 1.6 goes further and *reproduces* the
      layout as real virtual monitors (`mirror_client_monitor_layout` → `set_crtc_config`, xpra
      `x11/subsystem/display.py`), so remote applications snap and maximize to the same edges the
      user sees. Verified: the server's log goes from `monitor 0 is 'VFB-0'` to the local
      connector's name and size. Traps:
      - Sending this dict is what instantiates the server's `DisplayConnection` subsystem at all
        (`is_needed`), and once it is present the flattened pre-6.5 top-level spelling of these
        attributes is no longer read — which is why `show-desktop` had to move *into* the dict.
      - `resize-events: false` opts out of the server's legacy `desktop_size` notifications, which
        this client could not act on: it cannot resize the local display.
      - Monitor geometries are **physical** pixels with their raw, possibly negative coordinates
        (a monitor left of the primary one on Windows); the server rebases them itself
        (`get_normalized_monitor_definitions`). This is why no `scale-factor` is sent — xpra's own
        client reports GDK *logical* geometry plus an integer scale, and mixing the two
        conventions would have the server apply the scale twice. `width-mm`/`height-mm` are
        omitted too: winit exposes no physical dimensions and a number invented from an assumed
        DPI would poison the server's DPI heuristics.
      - The keys of the `monitors` dict are indices as *strings*, all our JSON-as-YAML writer can
        emit; the server puts them back through `int()` (`validated_monitor_data`, xpra
        `util/parsing.py` — also the list of every monitor attribute it accepts).
      - `primary` is always false on Wayland, where winit's `primary_monitor` returns nothing by
        design, and `available_monitors` can legitimately be empty (some compositors, a headless
        X11 display) — hence no size being sent at all rather than a `0x0` fallback.
      The legacy `screen_sizes` list is not sent: `monitors` replaced it in xpra 4.4, and the
      server only falls back to parsing it when a client sends no `monitors`
      (`get_monitor_definitions`).
    - **Monitor-relative coordinates**: every outgoing packet carrying a position sends, next to
      the absolute pair, a `{"index", "position"}` descriptor naming the monitor the point falls on
      and its offset within that monitor — `monitor_relative_position` /
      `monitor_descriptor` / `window_monitor_descriptor` in `client.rs`. This is what makes the
      absolute coordinates unambiguous: the geometries we send in `hello` keep their raw, possibly
      negative origin, but the server rebases the layout to a non-negative one before mirroring it
      (`normalized_monitors`), so it cannot map our absolute coordinates back on its own. Given the
      index and the offset it can — `get_monitor_position` (xpra `server/source/display.py`)
      resolves the pair against its *normalized* copy of the same layout. The descriptor is left
      out entirely when the point is on no known monitor; the server then falls back to the
      absolute coordinates. Where it goes differs per packet, and it is a trailing *positional*
      field on the one packet that stayed positional:
      - `pointer-motion` / `pointer-button`: the properties dict (fields 5 and 7). The dict has no
        other key to fill: the absolute pair is the packet's own pointer field, and
        `window-position` describes a position within the window, which the caller has already
        converted away.
      - `window-configure`: `monitor` in the config dict, next to `geometry`.
      - `window-map`: **appended as field 8**, since the server reads it only when the packet is
        long enough (`len(packet) >= 9`, xpra `x11/subsystem/window.py`) — hence an append rather
        than a null placeholder.
      For a *window* origin, the containing-monitor lookup is not enough: a top-left corner
      dragged past the left or top edge of its screen is outside every monitor, which is exactly
      when the server most needs the descriptor, so `window_monitor_descriptor` asks winit
      (`current_monitor`, matched back to our list by geometry) first and takes the offset against
      that monitor, negative or not. Which monitor gets named does not affect correctness: the
      server resolves the pair as `(monitor origin) + offset` with the offset measured against that
      same monitor, so the absolute point it lands on is the same whichever one is picked.
    - **Window metadata**: `metadata.supported` is limited to the properties this backend applies:
      title, decorations, fullscreen, maximized/iconic state, above/below level, size
      constraints — and `override-redirect`, which is not applied but *classifies* the window.
      The same `apply_window_metadata` path handles initial `new-window`/`window-create` metadata
      and incremental `window-metadata` packets; fixed minimum/maximum sizes disable resizing.
      The list is a filter the server applies to **every** metadata property it would send
      (`_make_metadata`, xpra `server/source/window.py`), so a property left out of it never
      arrives — which is the trap behind `override-redirect`: a server run with
      `XPRA_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBLE=0` sends no `new-override-redirect` packet at all (unmanaged
      windows are ordinary `window-create` packets flagged in their metadata), so without that
      entry every override-redirect window would arrive looking like a normal, decorated one.
      `process_new_common` therefore ORs the metadata flag into the packet-type one and works
      unchanged in both modes, as xpra's own client does
      (`client/subsystem/window/manager.py`). Trays are overloaded onto `window-create` the same
      way (`tray: true`), but we never advertise system-tray forwarding, so none are ever sent.
    - **Clipboard** (plain text only, `clipboard.rs` + the `process_clipboard_*` handlers): the
      server claims the clipboard with `clipboard-token` in backwards-compatible mode and with
      `clipboard-data` otherwise — the same event, but the second is not a rename: the targets,
      the `claim`/`greedy` flags and one `[dtype, dformat, wire_encoding, wire_data]` entry *per
      target* moved into an options dict, where the legacy packet was positional and could carry a
      single payload (xpra `clipboard/core.py` `_send_clipboard_token_handler`). Hence a second
      handler, `process_clipboard_data`. Either way a claim with no payload means "ask me", so
      both fall back to `send_clipboard_request`. One subtlety: a nested payload is never
      compressed nor sent as an out-of-band chunk (the sender strips the `Compressible` marker it
      cannot nest), so it is read with `yaml_bytes` on the dict value rather than
      `Packet::get_bytes` on a field index. What we send is already the modern `clipboard-data`.
    - **Authentication** (`process_challenge` in `client.rs`): a password-requiring server replies to our first
      `hello` with a `challenge` packet instead of its own hello. We advertise only `digest`/`salt-digest` =
      `["hmac+sha256"]`, so the server always picks that one digest (`choose_digest`, xpra `auth/sys_auth_base.py`).
      The reply is a **second** `hello` (`send_hello(Some((response, client_salt)))`) carrying `challenge_response`
      = `HMAC(password, HMAC(client_salt, server_salt))` (both HMACs lowercase-hex, via `net::sha256`). Two subtle
      points: (1) the incoming `server_salt` is a YAML `!!binary` scalar that `packet::get_bytes` already
      base64-decodes; (2) our writer emits JSON-as-YAML and *can't* carry raw binary, so `client_salt` is a random
      **ASCII hex** string (from `secure_hex`, OS-CSPRNG-seeded) rather than raw bytes — the server utf-8-decodes
      it back to the same bytes, so the digests still match. The password comes from, in order: `XPRA_PASSWORD`;
      `pinentry` if on `PATH` (driven over its Assuan protocol on a worker thread — `spawn_pinentry`/`run_pinentry`
      — which posts the result back as a synthesized `challenge-password`/`challenge-cancel` packet, the auth
      analogue of `draw-decoded`); otherwise the built-in `AuthDialog`. A wrong password ends with the server's
      `disconnect "authentication failed"` (→ `AuthenticationFailed`, exit 28); only `hmac+sha256` is handled, and
      `xor`/`des`/other digests fail cleanly. **Verify against a real server** (no test harness for this):
      `xpra start :N --bind-tcp=127.0.0.1:PORT --tcp-auth=password:value=PW`, then connect with `XPRA_PASSWORD=PW`
      (env path) or without it (pinentry / dialog path) and confirm `startup complete!`.
  - `auth_dialog.rs`: the built-in password prompt (`AuthDialog`) used when there is no
    `XPRA_PASSWORD` and no `pinentry` — a plain `winit`+`softbuffer` window drawn like `XpraWindow` but
    self-contained: it collects a password (echoing only `*`) and reports `Submit`/`Cancel` to `client.rs`, which
    routes its events in `window_event` *before* the `id_map` lookup (the dialog has no `wid`).
    Works on every platform, so it is the universal fallback (Windows without GnuPG in particular).
  - `connect_dialog.rs`: the **connection dialog** (`ConnectDialog`), shown when the binary is started with no
    argument at all — protocol drop-down (`tcp`/`ssl`/`ws`/`wss`/`ssh`, each pre-filling the port with its
    default: 10000, or 22 for ssh), host, port, optional username and password, plus `Cancel`/`Connect`. It only
    *collects*: `handle_key`/`handle_mouse` return a `ConnectAction`, whose `Connect(ConnectDetails)` carries a
    URI in exactly the form `parse_target` takes on the command line (`build_uri`, unit-tested against
    `parse_target`) plus the username/password. Connecting, and the state machine around it, live in `main.rs`.
    Two things it does that `auth_dialog.rs` does not: it is **DPI-aware** (a logical-size window, with the
    layout written in the units of a 100% display and scaled through `px()`/`font_scale()`), and it hit-tests the
    pointer itself (`Rect::contains` against rectangles computed in *physical* pixels, the same ones used to
    draw, so the two cannot drift apart). Fields freeze while a connection attempt is in flight (`Status`).
  - `font.rs` + `paint.rs`: what both dialogs draw with, since there is no text or widget dependency here.
    `font.rs` is Spleen 8x16 (BSD-2-Clause, credited in the file and in `README.md`), printable ASCII only,
    converted from the upstream BDF with the bit order reversed so bit 0 is the leftmost column; it replaced a
    public-domain 8x8 font that had to be drawn at double size and looked it. `paint.rs` is `fill_rect` and
    `outline`. Both dialogs measure text by counting characters, which only works because the font is monospaced
    (`font::GLYPH_W`/`GLYPH_H`, `font::text_width`).
  - `remote_logging.rs`: **client→server log forwarding** (xpra's `--remote-logging=send`), plus the whole of the
    *local* log output. `RemoteLogger` is the global `log::Log`: it prints locally via `LocalLogger` *and* forwards
    info-and-above
    records to the server as `logging-event` packets, so they land in the server's log file (handy when the client runs
    headless / its stderr isn't visible). `init()` (called from `main`)
    returns a `LogSink = Arc<Mutex<Option<EventLoopProxy<Packet>>>>` that starts empty; `XpraClient::process_hello`
    drops the proxy into it **only when the server's hello advertises `remote-logging.receive`** (a nested
    `{receive, send}` dict, xpra `server/subsystem/logging.py`), so we never send `logging-event` packets to a server
    that would reject them (verified against both `--remote-logging` default and `=no`). Forwarding, like the
    ping timer, doesn't touch the socket: the logger posts a synthesized client-side `send-log` packet (carrying
    the python logging level + text) via the proxy from *whatever* thread logged, and the UI thread turns it into
    the wire `logging-event` packet (`send_log` → `["logging-event", level, msg, dtime]`, `dtime` = ms since
    `start`). Two
    loop guards, mirroring xpra's own handler: only Info+ is forwarded (the write path only logs at debug/trace,
    or errors that set `exit_code` and make `write_json` a no-op — so a normal send never re-logs), and a
    thread-local `IN_FORWARD` flag stops a forward that itself logs from recursing. Level mapping is `log`→python:
    Error 40 / Warn 30 / Info 20.
    `LocalLogger` is what `simple_logger` used to do, hand-rolled — same output, byte for byte:
    `2026-07-30T09:42:06.176Z ERROR [xpra] message`, on **stdout** (not stderr), level padded to five columns and
    coloured red/yellow/cyan/purple with Trace left plain. Colour is decided once at init, as `colored` decided it:
    only when stdout is a terminal and `NO_COLOR` is unset — and on Windows only if `enable_ansi()` can turn
    `ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING` on, which `colored` used to do for us and without which conhost prints the
    escapes literally (Windows Terminal enables it itself). The timestamp comes from `SystemTime` through
    `civil_from_days`, Howard Hinnant's algorithm, which has the unit test — the epoch, a pre-epoch day (negative
    day numbers need flooring division, not truncating) and all three leap-year rules including 1900 and 2100.
    Dropping `simple_logger` took **nine** crates out of the graph (it and `colored`, plus the `time` tree behind its
    default `timestamps` feature) and, more importantly, unpinned the build from rustc 1.88: every `time` release
    `simple_logger 5.2.0` allows declares that MSRV, and since `simple_logger` itself declares none, cargo's
    MSRV-aware resolver could not back away from it. See the packaging notes below.
  - `signals.rs`: **graceful shutdown on an interrupt** — `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`/`SIGHUP` on Unix, the console
    control events (`Ctrl-C`, `Ctrl-Break`, console close, logoff, shutdown) on Windows. Installed once from
    `main::run`, and, like `tray.rs`'s window procedure, it cannot reach the `ActiveEventLoop`, so it posts a
    synthesized client-side `interrupt` packet through the `EventLoopProxy` and the UI thread does the rest
    (`disconnect_and_quit` in `client.rs`, or `App::user_event` when the connect dialog is still up and there is
    no session to say goodbye to). Two platform-specific points:
    - **Unix is a self-pipe**, not a direct `send_event`: a signal handler may only call async-signal-safe
      functions, which `EventLoopProxy::send_event` (allocates, locks) and every logging call are not. The
      handler writes the signal number into a pipe and a `signals` thread blocking in `read` turns it into the
      packet. `pipe`/`read`/`write`/`signal` are declared as `unsafe extern "C"` rather than pulled in as a libc
      dependency, the same as `client/mmap.rs`; `signal`'s handler is taken as a `usize` so that `SIG_DFL` (0)
      and `SIG_ERR` (-1), which are not valid function pointers, can be named. The handler restores `SIG_DFL`
      first, so a **second** interrupt kills the process outright — a shutdown stuck on a dead connection has to
      stay interruptible.
    - **Windows** needs none of that: `SetConsoleCtrlHandler`'s callback runs on an ordinary thread the OS
      injects, so it may call the proxy directly (handed to it through a `static Mutex`). Returning `TRUE` is
      what keeps a `Ctrl-C`/`Ctrl-Break` from terminating the process on the spot; close/logoff/shutdown are
      terminated regardless of the answer, so there the goodbye is a race rather than a guarantee. No new
      crate or feature: `Win32_System_Console` is already enabled for the logger's ANSI setup.
  - `tray.rs` (Windows-only, `#[cfg(windows)]`): the notification-area icon, its right-click menu (a greyed
    header naming the session, a separator, `Exit`) and the balloon notifications it raises. Hand-rolled on
    `Shell_NotifyIconW` via the `windows` crate
    Media Foundation already pulls in — no new crate, just the `Win32_UI_Shell`/`Win32_UI_WindowsAndMessaging`/
    `Win32_System_LibraryLoader`/`Win32_Graphics_Gdi` features (that last one only because `WNDCLASSW` and
    `RegisterClassW` are gated on it). Two non-obvious constraints, both easy to regress:
    (1) **no extra thread, by design.** Windows message delivery is thread-affine and winit's Windows backend
    pumps every window owned by the thread that called `run_app` — `PeekMessageW(&msg, 0, ..)` + `DispatchMessageW`
    (`0` = any window of the calling thread; dispatch goes to *that window's* class wndproc, ours not winit's),
    waiting in `MsgWaitForMultipleObjectsEx(.., QS_ALLINPUT, ..)`, which wakes on the shell's posted callback.
    So `Tray::new` is called from `XpraClient::resumed` on the UI thread and winit pumps it for free. The wndproc
    can't reach the `ActiveEventLoop` that `quit` needs, so `Exit` posts a synthesized client-side `tray-exit`
    packet through the `EventLoopProxy` — same pattern as `send-ping`/`draw-decoded`. The wndproc must never call
    `PostQuitMessage`: it shares winit's message queue.
    (2) the window is a never-shown *top-level* window, **not** `HWND_MESSAGE` — message-only windows don't
    receive broadcasts, and `TaskbarCreated` (re-add the icon after an explorer restart) is broadcast.
    `TrackPopupMenu` runs a nested modal loop, so the session stops repainting while the menu is open; that is
    normal for a native app, not a bug. Cleanup is `impl Drop` (`NIM_DELETE` + `DestroyWindow`), which runs
    because `main::run` holds the `XpraClient` in a local and drops it on return, on the UI thread.
    **Notifications** ride on the same icon and are therefore Windows-only: `show_notification` /
    `close_notification` are `Shell_NotifyIconW(NIM_MODIFY, ..)` with `NIF_INFO` set on a *copy* of the stored
    `NOTIFYICONDATAW` (the stored one keeps the `NIF_ICON|NIF_MESSAGE|NIF_TIP` flags the `TaskbarCreated`
    re-add needs). `szInfoTitle` = the notification's summary, `szInfo` = its body — and since a balloon with an
    empty `szInfo` is not shown at all, a body-less notification puts the summary in `szInfo` and the app name in
    the title. `dwInfoFlags` is `NIIF_USER` (with `NIF_ICON` so `hIcon` is read), which uses our own xpra icon as
    the balloon icon instead of the generic `NIIF_INFO` "i". Withdrawal is the same call with an empty `szInfo`,
    guarded by a `shown_notification: Option<u64>` so a `notify_close` for a *different* xpra `nid` doesn't take
    the current balloon down. Ignored by design (the user asked for the simple version): actions, hints, the
    per-notification icon, and `expire_timeout` (`uTimeout` has been ignored since Vista). On Windows 10+ the
    shell turns balloons into toasts and applies its own Focus-assist/notification policy, so one legitimately
    landing in the Action Center rather than on screen is not a bug. `client.rs`'s `process_notify_show` still
    logs every notification on every platform (that log line is also what remote logging sends the server); the
    tray call is an extra `#[cfg(windows)]` step after it.
  - `window.rs`: `XpraWindow` owns a `winit::window::Window`, a `softbuffer::Surface`, and a persistent
    `framebuffer: Vec<u32>` (softbuffer only hands you the *live* to-be-presented buffer on each
    `buffer_mut()` call, not a persistently addressable store, so `XpraWindow` keeps its own full-window pixel
    buffer as the source of truth). `paint()` converts decoded pixels (jpeg/webp/h264/mmap → `BGRA`,
    png → `RGBA8`) into
    softbuffer's `0x00RRGGBB` `u32` format per-pixel and writes the damaged sub-rect into `framebuffer`;
    `draw_screen()` (on `WindowEvent::RedrawRequested`) copies the whole `framebuffer` into the surface buffer
    and presents it; `resize()` reallocates `framebuffer` (zero-filled — relies on the server re-sending damage
    after a `window-configure` round-trip rather than preserving old contents).
  - `draw_decoder.rs`: decodes `jpeg` (via `turbojpeg`), `png` (via `spng`) and `webp` (via `libwebp-sys`)
    payloads into raw pixel buffers — platform-independent, unchanged by the GUI backend. These are *stateless*
    (one packet in, one image out). `webp` uses `WebPDecodeBGRA`, which both allocates its output (so the pixels
    have to be copied into a `Vec` and the buffer handed back to `WebPFree`) and hands back BGRA — the same layout
    turbojpeg produces, so `window::paint` treats `webp` exactly like `jpeg` and no new pixel path was needed.
  - `mmap.rs` (POSIX-only): **shared-memory picture transfers**, server → client. When both ends are on the
    same host, the server writes raw pixels into a file we create and map `MAP_SHARED`, and its `draw` packets
    carry only `(offset, length)` pairs into that area instead of an encoded image. On by default (like xpra's
    `--mmap=auto`); `XPRA_MMAP=no` turns it off, `XPRA_MMAP=/path` pins the backing file (an existing one is
    taken as-is and never removed — that is how xpra's virtio-shmem setup works), `XPRA_MMAP_DIR` /
    `XPRA_MMAP_SIZE` tune the rest. **No new crate**: `std` already links libc, so the only FFI is two
    `unsafe extern "C"` declarations (`mmap`/`munmap`) plus `PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE`/`MAP_SHARED` — same
    hand-rolled-over-a-library preference as `net/sha256.rs` and `net/websocket.rs`. Windows would need a
    *named file mapping* rather than a file (it would only ever help against a shadow server on the same
    machine), so `MmapArea::create` just returns `None` there and no capability is advertised at all.
    The traps, all of them easy to regress:
    - **The prefixes cross over.** We send `mmap.read` (the area *we* read from); the server looks it up as
      its write area (`write_caps = tdcaps.dictget("read")`, xpra `server/source/mmap.py`) and replies under
      `mmap.write`, which is what we must read back. The prefixed form arrived in xpra **6.3**, below the 6.4
      protocol we announce, so the pre-6.3 unprefixed spelling is not sent (it *is* still accepted inbound,
      since a backwards-compatible server duplicates its caps that way).
    - **The token exchange is the locality check.** There is no hostname comparison anywhere: each side writes
      a random token into the area and has the other read it back. A remote server simply fails to open the
      path (or finds a different file) and answers with no caps — `check_server_caps` returns `Ok(false)`, the
      area is dropped and the session carries on with jpeg/webp. Only a token that is *present but wrong* is
      fatal (`MmapTokenFailure`, 10): the server then believes mmap is live and is writing pixels somewhere we
      cannot see. The server's token is `uuid4().int` zero-padded to 128 bytes, i.e. **128 bits**, which
      yaml-rust2 hands back as a `Yaml::Real` holding the decimal digits rather than a `Yaml::Integer` — hence
      the `u128` parse. Ours is 8 bytes, so it stays inside what the JSON-as-YAML writer can emit.
    - **`encoding.rgb_formats = ["BGRX"]` is mandatory**, not decoration: the server defaults to `("RGB",)`,
      three bytes per pixel, which `window::paint` cannot render. BGRX is also X11's native little-endian
      layout, so the server ends up doing no conversion at all, and listing no alpha format makes it flatten
      any window that has one (our framebuffer is opaque `0x00RRGGBB`).
    - **`rowstride` (draw packet field 9) finally matters** — this is the only place it is read. For a damage
      sub-rectangle it is the *whole window's* stride, not `w*4`: xpra hands out zero-copy sub-images that keep
      their parent's stride (`XImageWrapper.get_sub_image`). `destride` copies row by row into a tightly packed
      `w*h*4` buffer, so everything downstream sees the same shape turbojpeg/spng/libwebp produce.
    - **Every mmap draw must end in `release()`**, painted or not. The first 8 bytes of the area are two u32
      control words in native byte order — `data_start` (ours) and `data_end` (the server's) — and the server
      does not reuse ring space until `data_start` moves past it (xpra `server/window/compress.py`: "never
      cancel mmap after encoding because we need to reclaim the space"). Hence the `Ordering::Release` store
      after the copy, and the release on the error paths in `read_mmap_draw`. The server wraps the ring and
      will split one image into **two chunks** at an arbitrary byte offset, so a single row can straddle them.
    - The area is **unlinked as soon as the handshake is over** (the server has it mapped by then), which is
      why `unlink` takes `&self` behind an `AtomicBool`: the decode thread holds the other `Arc`.
    - Enabling mmap makes the server stop using **every other encoding** for non-shaped, non-grayscale windows
      (`update_encoding_selection`) — that is the point, not a bug. The area must be ≥ 64MiB or the server
      discards it (`MMAP_Server.min_size`); the default is 128MiB, sparse.
  - `mediafoundation.rs` (Windows-only, `#[cfg(windows)]`): `h264` video decode via Media Foundation — no
    third-party codec is linked (the decoder lives in the OS, `msmpeg2vdec.dll`; +~13KB to the binary, just the
    COM/MF bindings from the `windows` crate). Pipeline is `CLSID_CMSH264DecoderMFT` (H.264 Annex-B → NV12) →
    `CLSID_VideoProcessorMFT` (NV12 → RGB32, which in memory is softbuffer's BGRA), so `window::paint` treats
    h264 exactly like turbojpeg's BGRA. Unlike jpeg/png the decoder is **stateful** (H.264 is inter-frame
    predicted): `start_draw_decode_loop` keeps a per-`wid` `HashMap<u64, H264Decoder>` local to the decode thread
    (these COM objects never cross threads, so nothing is `Send`). `H264Decoder::decode` returns
    `Ok(Some(bgra))` (frame ready), `Ok(None)` (input consumed, decoder still warming up — the sequence is still
    acked, painting is skipped), or `Err`. Advertising is Windows-only and needs *two* things for the server to
    actually send video: `h264` in the advertised encoding lists (`encoding.options`/`encoding.core`, which
    `send_hello` fills from one `encodings` vec), **and** a nested `encoding` caps dict with
    `full_csc_modes = {"h264": ["YUV420P"]}` (the server reads `hello["encoding"]["full_csc_modes"]` and only
    offers a video encoding whose listed colourspaces intersect its encoder's — see xpra
    `server/source/encoding.py`). We list only `YUV420P` and pin `encoding.h264 = {"YUV420P.profile": "high"}`
    because the MF decoder only handles 8-bit 4:2:0 up to High profile (never 4:2:2/4:4:4/High10).
    Colour range is handled explicitly: MF's H.264 decoder doesn't reliably surface the VUI
    `video_full_range_flag`, and xpra's encoders default to *full* range and only send the `full-range` draw
    option on transitions/keyframes (omitted in steady state), so `H264Decoder` tracks it per-stream
    (defaulting to `true`, `None` = unchanged) and stamps `MF_MT_VIDEO_NOMINAL_RANGE` on the Video Processor's
    NV12 input. The remaining unverified knob is RGB32 orientation (we request top-down via a positive
    `MF_MT_DEFAULT_STRIDE`); `MF_MT_YUV_MATRIX` is left to the VP's pick-by-resolution BT.601/709 default.
    Per-window decoders are released when the window closes: the UI thread forwards `lost-window` down the
    same channel as draws (so still-queued draws for that window drain first), and the decode loop drops that
    `wid`'s `H264Decoder`.

- `src/main.rs`: binary entry point. Builds a `winit::event_loop::EventLoop<Packet>`, spawns the decode thread,
  and runs `event_loop.run_app(&mut app)`. `App` — **not** `XpraClient` — is the `ApplicationHandler` for the
  process, because **winit allows one event loop per process** (`EventLoopError::RecreationAttempt`), so the
  connection dialog cannot be a throwaway loop run before the client's. `App` is therefore a two-state machine:
  - `AppState::Session(XpraClient)`, entered immediately when a target was given on the command line (parsed and
    connected *before* the event loop exists, so a bad address still exits with the right code and no window),
    or later from the dialog. Every `ApplicationHandler` callback `XpraClient` implements is delegated to it,
    which is a thing to keep in sync when adding one there.
  - `AppState::Prompt(Option<ConnectDialog>)` otherwise: the dialog is created in `resumed` (creating a window
    needs the `ActiveEventLoop`). `Connect` runs `connect()` on a **worker thread** — a dropped SYN takes tens of
    seconds to time out and the dialog must keep drawing — which hands the `Connection` back over a channel and
    posts a synthesized client-side `connect-result` packet, the same pattern as `pinentry`/`draw-decoded`.
    A failure is shown in the dialog and retried, not exited on. On success `start_session` builds the client,
    passes it the dialog's softbuffer `Context` and the collected username/password, and **calls `resumed` on it
    by hand**: winit only fires `resumed` once, back when the dialog was up.

  `XpraClient::username`/`password` are `None` on the command-line path; when the dialog filled them in, the
  username overrides the environment's in `hello` and the password is the first source `process_challenge` tries.

### Threading model

Three threads, and GUI/`winit`/`softbuffer` calls must only ever happen on the UI thread:

1. **UI thread** (`main`) — runs the `winit` event loop, owns `XpraClient` and all `XpraWindow`/softbuffer state.
2. **Reader thread** (`XpraClient::start_read_loop`) — blocking loop calling `net::io::read_packet` on the
   socket, parses each payload into a `Packet`, and sends it straight to the UI thread via
   `EventLoopProxy::send_event` (delivered as `ApplicationHandler::user_event`).
3. **Decode thread** (`XpraClient::start_draw_decode_loop`) — receives `draw` packets forwarded by the UI thread
   over a plain `mpsc::Sender<Packet>` (no `EventLoopProxy` equivalent exists for UI-thread → other-thread), calls
   `draw_decoder::decode` to turn compressed image data into a raw pixel buffer off the UI thread, then sends the
   result back to the UI thread as a synthesized `draw-decoded` (or `decoding-failed`) packet via its own
   `EventLoopProxy<Packet>` clone. `mmap` draws go through this same thread (holding an `Arc<MmapArea>`) rather
   than being read on the UI thread, even though "decoding" one is only a strided copy: routing every coding
   through one channel is what keeps draws in the order the server sent them, which matters because a shaped or
   grayscale window still gets a real encoding while the rest of the session is on mmap.

`ApplicationHandler::user_event` is the only place that receives packets from these threads and dispatches them
via `do_process_packet`.

### Shutdown / connection loss / exit codes

`[profile.release]` sets `panic = "abort"`, so a panic on *any* thread kills the whole process — the I/O paths
must return errors, not `unwrap()`. Only the UI thread can stop the event loop (`ActiveEventLoop::exit` is only
reachable from an `ApplicationHandler` callback), so the reader thread (on read/parse failure) and the write path
(on a failed `write_packet`) both synthesize a client-side packet — `connection-lost` or `invalid-packet`, neither
of which exists on the wire — and send it to the UI thread through the usual `EventLoopProxy`, which logs the
reason and exits. The decode thread just breaks out of its loop when its `mpsc` channel closes (UI thread gone) —
a killed server used to abort here with `RecvError`.

A shutdown we *chose* — the Windows tray's `Exit` item, or an interrupt caught by `client/signals.rs` — goes
through `disconnect_and_quit`, which tells the server why (`["connection-close", reason]`, the packet formerly
known as `disconnect`) and exits with `Ok`. The packet has to be written **before** `quit`, which sets
`exit_code` and thereby turns `write_json` into a no-op. Nothing has to flush it: writes are synchronous
`Connection::write_all` calls on the UI thread, so the bytes are in the socket before the event loop even
unwinds (verified — the server logs `client has requested disconnection: client interrupted`).

`XpraClient::quit` records the cause in `exit_code: Option<ExitCode>` (first cause wins) and stops the event loop;
`main::run` returns it and `main` hands it to `process::exit`. A set `exit_code` also silently drops further
outgoing packets, since the event loop keeps delivering queued input events on its way out.

`src/exit_codes.rs` mirrors the subset of xpra's own `ExitCode` (`xpra/exit_codes.py`) that we can produce, so
wrapper scripts see the same values as with the python client: `ConnectionFailed`(18) for anything that fails
before there is a session (connect refused, ws handshake, garbage from a non-xpra peer, kicked out before
`startup-complete`), `SslFailure`(16)/`SshFailure`(8) for those transports' setup, `ConnectionLost`(1) once the
session was up, `PacketFailure`(9) for an unparseable packet mid-session, `AuthenticationFailed`(28),
`MmapTokenFailure`(10) for a shared-memory area the server wrote a wrong token into (see `client/mmap.rs`),
`ArgumentMismatch`(34) for a bad command line, and `Ok`(0) for a plain server-sent `disconnect`. The
before/after-`startup_complete` split and `disconnect_is_an_error` mirror xpra's `client/base/client.py`
(`_process_connection_lost`, `server_disconnect_exit_code`) — a disconnect whose reason mentions "error" (or a
non-idle "timeout") is a failure, everything else ("server shutdown", "new client", ...) is a normal goodbye.

## Distribution packaging (`packaging/`)

RPM and DEB build definitions for [repo-build-scripts](https://github.com/Xpra-org/repo-build-scripts), which
builds them in per-distribution containers. Mirrors the layout of xpra's own `packaging/`, but for a single
package: `packaging/target-repository` (`beta`), `packaging/rust-xpra.desktop`, `packaging/rust-xpra.1`
(the man page — installed by the spec's `%install` and, on the Debian side, by `dh_installman` via
`rust-xpra.manpages`; it documents the *installed* name, so `rust-xpra(1)`, since `xpra(1)` is the python
client's), `packaging/rpm/`
(`rust-xpra.spec` + `default.list`, the last-resort manifest name the build scripts look for, holding just
`rust-xpra`), and `packaging/debian/` (`build.sh`, which unpacks the tarball and runs `debuild`, plus
`rust-xpra/` which becomes the source tree's `debian/`). `packaging/README.md` has the details; the traps:

- **The binary installs as `/usr/bin/rust-xpra`**, not `xpra` — that path belongs to the python `xpra` package
  and the two must be co-installable. Both builds rename it; the cargo binary is still called `xpra`.
- **`spng-sys` forces `libz-sys/static`**, so zlib is always compiled from source and bundled. Both builds
  therefore have to turn the distribution's LTO off — `%global _lto_cflags %{nil}` in the spec, `optimize=-lto`
  in `debian/rules`' `DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS`: a global `-flto` reaches every C file the `cc` crate compiles
  through `$CFLAGS`, and the resulting LTO objects break archive member resolution — the link fails on
  `undefined reference to inflateInit_`. Do not "clean this up". Fedora and Ubuntu both enable it by default
  (Ubuntu through dpkg's `optimize=+lto`, which Debian leaves off — hence a failure that only showed up on
  Ubuntu). The Rust-side `lto = true` in `Cargo.toml` is unrelated and stays on.
- **`TURBOJPEG_SOURCE` and `TURBOJPEG_STATIC` must move together.** Both builds probe with
  `pkg-config --atleast-version=3.0 libturbojpeg` and fall back to the crate's vendored copy where the system one
  is too old (EL9 ships 2.0.90 in CRB, Debian trixie and Ubuntu 24.04 ship 2.1.5) — which is what `cmake` and
  `nasm` are build dependencies for. Setting `TURBOJPEG_STATIC=0` on the *vendored* path makes `turbojpeg-sys`
  emit `-l dylib=turbojpeg`, which links the too-old system library and fails on `undefined reference to tj3Init`.
  Hence `%{turbojpeg_static}` / `$(if $(filter vendor,...))` rather than a constant.
- `--features webp-dylib` is passed unconditionally so `libwebp-sys` links the distro's shared libwebp.
- **Six runtime dependencies are listed by hand** (`libX11`, `libXcursor`, `libXi`, `libxcb`, `libxkbcommon`,
  `libwayland-client`): winit, softbuffer and x11rb `dlopen` them, so neither `dh_shlibdeps` nor rpm's dependency
  generator can see them. Anything new that gets `dlopen`ed has to be added to both.
- `debian/rules` appends the `embedded-library libjpeg` lintian override itself, and only on the vendored path —
  in the static overrides file it would be a `mismatched-override` warning everywhere else.
- **`Cargo.lock` is in `.gitignore`**, so the release tarball carries none and cargo re-resolves against live
  crates.io on every build: two builds of the same tarball can differ. Committing it would fix that and make the
  declared `rust >= 1.85` / `rustc (>= 1.85)` exact rather than merely correct.
- **That re-resolution is what makes old distributions work, and `edition = "2024"` is what makes it
  rust-version aware — do not downgrade the edition to widen compatibility, it does the opposite.** The edition
  implies `resolver = "3"`; with no `rust-version` in `Cargo.toml`, cargo takes the MSRV from *the toolchain it
  is running under* (verified: making rustc report 1.75 resolves indexmap 2.11.4 / native-tls 0.2.13 /
  openssl 0.10.78, exactly as an explicit `rust-version = "1.75"` does). So each distribution gets the newest
  dependency set its own toolchain can build and none of them holds the others back. `edition = "2021"`
  silently selects `resolver = "2"`, which is not rust-version aware at all. Two corollaries: `resolver = "3"`
  needs cargo 1.84, so `edition = "2021"` + an explicit `resolver = "3"` buys exactly one cargo version and is
  not worth it; and `rust-version` must stay *unset*, since declaring one applies to every build host and would
  pin Fedora to Debian's floor (it is also a hard error to declare one below 1.85 while on edition 2024).
  The fallback is a preference, not a rule — cargo still takes an incompatible version when a requirement has
  no compatible one — so this is correct, not exact.
- **Three target releases need a toolchain other than the default `rustc`**, hence the build-dependency
  alternatives `cargo-web | cargo-1.85 | cargo` / `rustc-web | rustc-1.85 | rustc (>= 1.85)`, most specific
  first. Debian trixie/sid are fine as-is (1.85/1.95). Bookworm's `rustc` is 1.63, but `rustc-web`/`cargo-web`
  — the 1.85 toolchain Debian keeps in **main** so Firefox can be built — are there, and `rustc-web` carries
  `Provides: rustc (= 1.85…)`. `cargo-web` must win over `cargo`: bookworm's `cargo` is 0.66 and only
  `Depends: rustc (>= 1.24)`, so apt would pair it with rustc-web quite happily — and cargo is what parses the
  manifest, so it rejects edition 2024 before rustc is ever run. Ubuntu jammy/noble default to 1.75 and carry
  `rustc-1.85`/`cargo-1.85` in `<release>-updates/universe`; those install into `/usr/lib/rust-1.85/bin`,
  register no alternative and Provide nothing, which is why `debian/rules` prepends that directory to `$PATH`
  when it exists. `cargo` stays unversioned in `Build-Depends` — Debian numbered it 0.66 in bookworm and only
  lined it up with rustc from trixie on, so `cargo (>= 1.85)` would be unsatisfiable on the one release that
  needs it.
- The `Source:` URL points at the `v<version>` GitHub tag, so **the tag has to exist** before a build; the version
  there and in `debian/changelog` must match.

Verified end to end for 0.3.0 on Fedora 44 (rpm), Debian trixie (deb, vendored turbojpeg) and Debian sid (deb,
system turbojpeg) — all three install and run, lintian reports only `initial-upload-closes-no-bugs`.

## Dependency graph (`docs/`)

`docs/dependency-graph.html` is a generated, self-contained interactive map of the crate graph for both targets
(radial graph / `cargo tree`-style tree / sortable table). **Regenerate it whenever `Cargo.toml`'s dependencies
change** — `python3 docs/dependency-graph.py`, which rewrites it from `docs/dependency-graph.template.html` (edit
the template, never the generated file). Needs only python 3 and `cargo`; the Windows target needs no toolchain
installed, since `cargo tree --target` merely resolves. The edges come from `cargo tree`, **not** `cargo
metadata`, whose `resolve` graph is not feature-resolved and reports optional dependencies nothing enables.
Output is byte-stable for a given resolution, but `Cargo.lock` is gitignored, so counts can shift between runs on
their own — which is why the crate counts quoted in `README.md`'s **Dependencies** section are the one thing the
script cannot keep current. Check them when regenerating.

`docs/` is also the **GitHub Pages** source (Settings → Pages → deploy from a branch, `main` + `/docs`), served
at <https://xpra-org.github.io/rust-xpra/>, which is what `README.md` links to. Jekyll turns `docs/README.md`
into the landing page and copies the graph through untouched (it has no front matter); `docs/_config.yml` holds
the theme and excludes the generator and template from the published site. Links in `docs/README.md` to anything
outside `docs/` must be absolute GitHub URLs — a relative `../README.md` resolves on github.com but 404s on the
Pages site, since only `docs/` is published.

## Known repo quirks

- `build.rs` embeds the Windows resources: `assets/xpra.ico` (name id `1` — the executable's icon in Explorer,
  and what `tray.rs` loads back at runtime with `LoadImageW`) and `exe.manifest` (the per-monitor-V2 DPI
  manifest, which used to be carried in the repo unreferenced). It gates on `CARGO_CFG_TARGET_OS`, **not**
  `cfg!(windows)`: a build script runs on the *host*, so `cfg!` asks the wrong question and would silently drop
  the resources from a Linux→Windows cross build. For the same reason `winresource` is a plain
  `[build-dependencies]` — Cargo resolves target-specific build-deps against the host too. A failed resource
  compile only warns; `tray.rs` then falls back to `IDI_APPLICATION`. The manifest asks for the same DPI
  awareness winit sets programmatically (`become_dpi_aware`), so embedding it changes no behaviour.
- **Do not enable `libwebp-sys`'s `sse41` / `avx2` features.** They look like free speed and are neither free nor
  speed. `libwebp-sys`' `build.rs` puts `-msse4.1`/`-mavx2` on the *whole* `cc::Build` — every vendored `.c` file,
  unlike libwebp's own CMake, which applies them per-file precisely so that the generic and SSE2 paths stay
  baseline. With `avx2` on, `dec_sse2.o` (the path libwebp's *runtime* CPU dispatch picks on any SSE2 machine)
  comes out full of VEX-encoded instructions and even `ymm` registers, so the binary `SIGILL`s on any pre-AVX2
  CPU (pre-2013 Intel, and current low-power Celeron/Pentium/Atom N-series — exactly the thin clients this is
  for), runtime dispatch notwithstanding.
  And they buy nothing measurable, on either of the two encodings xpra actually sends (it picks lossless VP8L for
  text-heavy/few-colour rects and lossy VP8 for the rest). Best-of-7 × 200 iterations on an i7-6700K, which has
  both feature bits, with the kernels confirmed compiled in (37 `SSE41` symbols vs 9 in the default build, 38
  `AVX2` ones) and therefore dispatched:

  |                       | default (SSE2) | `sse41` | `sse41`+`avx2` |
  |-----------------------|----------------|---------|----------------|
  | 1080p lossy (VP8)     | 8.92 ms        | 8.97 ms | 8.82 ms        |
  | 1080p lossless (VP8L) | 9.50 ms        | 9.54 ms | 9.40 ms        |
  | text lossy (VP8)      | 5.72 ms        | 5.70 ms | 5.70 ms        |
  | text lossless (VP8L)  | 0.58 ms        | 0.57 ms | 0.63 ms        |

  All within noise. For `avx2` that is structural, not luck: `lossless_avx2.c` is the *only* decode-side AVX2 file
  in libwebp, so AVX2 has no lossy-VP8-decode kernels to run at all, and the VP8L ones it does have don't move the
  needle. SSE4.1 does have real lossy-decode kernels (`dec_sse41.c`, `upsampling_sse41.c`, `yuv_sse41.c`) — they
  just don't beat the SSE2 ones the decoder already uses.
